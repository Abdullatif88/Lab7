		I’m a 2nd year Master of Science Student at the Geography Department, Texas State University.
        I received my Bachelor of Art in Geography from Kuwait, where I’m from. I’m interests in
        Maps and Cartography in general, and how to explore spatial data through Geovisualization and
        using Geovisual Analytics. I’m currently focusing on visualizing social media and
        crowdsourced data for mapping inundation surfaces caused by flood events.
